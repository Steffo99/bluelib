//! These mixins allow the abstraction of the colors used by elements by having them use named "groups".
//!
//! For example, the body's foreground color and the buttons' background color might use the "foreground" group, whose color may be dynamically changed at the time of the page viewing.
//!
//! Color mixins can only be defined via HSL due to the absence of color interpolation functions in the CSS Color Level 4 Specification.


/// Set the CSS variables of a certain group to the given values.
///
/// See also `.use-color-group`.

}


/// Set a CSS property to the color obtained from the CSS variables of the given group.
///
/// The color may be altered via the third, fourth and fifth parameters, which specify a string calculation to be appended to the CSS variables in a calc function.

/// For example, acceptable parameters may be: "+ 10deg", "/ 2", "* 1000", "- var(--something)", and so on.
